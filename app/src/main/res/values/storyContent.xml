        <item>One day the Buffalo was bathing in the river when he finished his work, he bathed all day until the sun covered it. The next day buffalo was walking to where the work was with his Boss until the day but there was an animal that was getting cold because of the extreme cold and his help and it was goat.</item>
        <item>When goat saw that it was cold, he went to the place to help but goat was very afraid of the water because he could get wet. What buffalo did was he hauled a few banana leaves and made it look like a hut so that goat would have a shelter.</item>
        <item>The next day, they realized that the weather was fine when they got out of the hut made of buffalo. into the garden with a little blue crockery bowl, to pick some currants for her tea. After the currants were picked she sat on the back door-step and stemmed them, collecting the stems carefully in her apron, and afterwards throwing them into the hen-coop. She looked sharply at the grass beside the step to see if any had fallen there.</item>
        <item>Goat continues to put in his heart the help that buffalo did for him: He must be helpful to others, especially when your help is needed.</item>
